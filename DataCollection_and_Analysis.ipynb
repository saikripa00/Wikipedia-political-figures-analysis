        "Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) is reworking access to their APIs. It is likely in the coming years that all API access will require some kind of authentication, either through a simple key/token or through some version of OAuth. For now this is still a work in progress. You can follow the progress from their [API portal](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). Another on-going change is better control over API services in situations where those services require additional computational resources, beyond simply serving the text of a web page (i.e., the text of an article). Services like ORES that require running an ML model over the text of an article page is an example of a compute intensive API service.\n",

        "Wikimedia is implementing a new Machine Learning (ML) service infrastructure that they call [LiftWing](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Machine_Learning/LiftWing). Given that ORES already has several ML models that have been well used, ORES is the first set of APIs that are being moved to LiftWing.\n",

The [ORES LiftWing documentation](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Machine_Learning/LiftWing/Usage) is very thin ... even thinner than the standard ORES documentation. Further, it is clear that some parameters have been renamed (e.g., \"revid\" in the old ORES API is now \"rev_id\" in the LiftWing ORES API).\n",

One should be able to simply pass in a new article revision id on each call and get back a python dictionary as the result. A valid result will be a dictionary that contains the probabilities that the specific revision is one of six different article quality levels.
